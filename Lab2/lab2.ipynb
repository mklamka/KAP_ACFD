        "# 1 Dimentional Unsteady Diffusion Equation\n",
        "The famous diffusion equation, also known as the heat equation, reads\n",
        "\n",
        "$\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = \\alpha \\cdot \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} $,\n",
        "\n",
        "where $u(x,t)$ is the unknown function to be solved for, $x$ is a coordinate in space, and $t$ is time. The coefficient $\\alpha$ is the diffusion coefficient and determines how fast $u$ changes in time. A quick short form for the diffusion equation is $u_t=α\\cdot u_{xx}$.\n",
        "\n",
        "Compared to the wave equation, $u_{tt}=2 c\\cdot  u_{xx}$, which looks very similar, but the diffusion equation features solutions that are very different from those of the wave equation. Also, the diffusion equation makes quite different demands to the numerical methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "Typical diffusion problems may experience rapid change in the very beginning, but then the evolution of u becomes slower and slower. The solution is usually very smooth, and after some time, one cannot recognize the initial shape of u. This is in sharp contrast to solutions of the wave equation where the initial shape is preserved - the solution is basically a moving initial condition. The standard wave equation utt=c2uxx has solutions that propagates with speed c forever, without changing shape, while the diffusion equation converges to a stationary solution $u(x)$ as $t→∞$. In this limit, ut=0, and u¯ is governed by u¯′′(x)=0. This stationary limit of the diffusion equation is called the Laplace equation and arises in a very wide range of applications throughout the sciences.\n",
        "\n",
        "It is possible to solve for u(x,t) using a explicit scheme. And of more importance, since the solution u of the diffusion equation is very smooth and changes slowly, small time steps are not convenient and not required by accuracy as the diffusion process converges to a stationary state."
